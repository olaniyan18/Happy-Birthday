            Happy Birthday, babessss Ronke!

            From our days as roommates, I have always admired your sweetness, creativity, and how impeccably neat and organized you always were. Always keeping your space tidy and your thoughts clear. It’s been inspiring to watch you turn that passion into a fantastic fashion business with TBB. Your journey is a testament to your talent and determination.
            
            I pray that TBB continues to flourish and that you find joy and success in every step of your journey. You’re diligent in your work, so, I pray you stand before kings and queens. May your future be filled with endless opportunities, love, and happiness.  
            
            I love you, plenty.❤️
