            Happy birthday Bibi! 🎂🥳
            I’m praying that you’re blessed with everything as wonderful as you are as you start this new year of life. 
            We’ve made some great memories, all of which I owe to you! It’s such a joy to know you. 
            
            Enjoy your special day Bibi. I wish you only the best ❤️
